<h1>The Great Molasses Flood</h1>
<p>The Great Molasses Flood of January 15, 1919, was a disaster where a giant tank full of molasses burst open onto Boston's North End. More than 2 million gallons of molasses flooded through Boston and killed about 21 people, injuring around 150 more people. Houses were destroyed, horses and people were trapped in the molasses, and the town was in shock and shambles. Its said that the smell of molasses lingered in the Boston streets for decades after.</p>
